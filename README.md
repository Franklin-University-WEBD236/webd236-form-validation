# WEBD 236 Model 2 (with OO) Starter

This project is a good place to start using the MVC framework in an object-oriented way in WEBD 236.

Goals are:
  - Migrate to objects for Model, View, and Controller
  - Create an auto-loader to avoid imports
  - Use the Validator class effectively
  - Move to hashed passwords
